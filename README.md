1- Differences between merge, rebase, squash, and cherry-pick
Merge: Joins two branches together while preserving the history of all the commits made.
Rebase: Taking commits from one branch and adding it onto another in order to have a clean linear history.
Squash: Takes multiple commits made and bundles them into one, and that makes it more clean and understandable.
Cherry-pick: Copies a commit from one branch to another, and especially used for hotfixes.
